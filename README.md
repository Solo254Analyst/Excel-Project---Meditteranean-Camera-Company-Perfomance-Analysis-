# Meditteranean-Camera-Company-Perfomance-Analysis

This project was my entry to the FP20 Analytics Challenge 2 "Mediterranean Camera Company" on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12751070/). The raw dataset is available [here](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Ako3bcZWyMh-71PEv25lzP_E5Gje?e=CnsX9w).Ms Excel was used in the entire analysis proces. The following Excel skills were applied in the project: PIVOT TABLE, COUNTIF, POWER PIVOT, HIERACHYS - DRILL DOWN/UP, FILTERING AND SORTING, CHARTS, and SLICERS

## The Analysis

The analysis focussed on key perfomance indicators at Meditteranean Camera Company. These KPIs include sales, profit, and profit margin. Five areas of interest we identfitied: country of sale, customers, discounty type, product, and performance over time (monthyly and quartely perfomance). Here are the key findings from the analysis:

### Country of Sale:
1) The UK and France had the most sales, and profit respectively 

### Monthly and Quarterly Performance:
2) The fourth quarter registered the highest sales and profit
3) The first quarter was the least performing quarter - lowerst profits and gross sales

### Customers:
4) Business with corporations resulted in the lowest profit margins
5) Resellers, despite registring the lowerst gross sales had highest profit margin

### Discount Type:
6) The low discount band had the most profit in comparison to the medium and high discount band. The lower the discount the higher the profit.
7) However, undiscounted sales generated the least revenue and profit. This shows that discounts attract customers.  

### Product:
8) Camera 3 is the best selling product, most profitable, and also most promising heading into the future.
9) Although Camera 5 registred some impressive sales, its cumulative trends shows sings of possible profit decline in the future.
10) Camera 1 had the best profit margin.
