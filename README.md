# Meditteranean-Camera-Company-Perfomance-Analysis

This project was my entry to the FP20 Analytics Challenge 2 "Mediterranean Camera Company" on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12751070/). The raw dataset is available [here](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Ako3bcZWyMh-71PEv25lzP_E5Gje?e=CnsX9w). MS Excel was used in the entire analysis process. The following Excel skills were applied: PIVOT TABLES, COUNTIF, POWER PIVOT, HIERACHYS - DRILL DOWN/UP, FILTERING AND SORTING, CHARTS, and SLICERS

## The Analysis

The analysis focussed on key performance indicators at Meditteranean Camera Company. These KPIs include sales, profit, and profit margin. Five areas of interest were identified: country of sale, customers, discount type, product, and performance over time (monthly and quarterly performance). Here are the key findings from the analysis:

### Country of Sale:
1) The UK and France had the most sales, and profit respectively 

### Monthly and Quarterly Performance:
2) The fourth quarter registered the highest sales and profit
3) The first quarter was the least performing - lowest profits and sales

### Customers:
4) Business with corporations resulted in the lowest profit margins â€“ 4%. This is alarming.
5) Resellers, despite registering the lowest gross sales had the highest profit margin

### Discount Type:
6) The low discount band had the most profit in comparison to the medium and high discount bands. The lower the discount the higher the profit.
7) Undiscounted sales generated the least revenue and profit. This shows that discounts attract customers.  

### Product:
8) Camera 3 is the best-selling product, most profitable, and also most promising heading into the future.
9) Although Camera 5 registered some impressive sales, its cumulative profit trend is weakening. 
10) Camera 1 had the best profit margin.
